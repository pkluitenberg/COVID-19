# COVID-19
---------------
As we all know, the novel coronavirus COVID-19 is sweeping around the globe. I recently ran across the European Center for Disease
Prevention and Control's website. They have a daily excel file that they post with new cases & deaths by country and report date.
While the information provided is minimal, I thought it could be fun to dig a bit deeper into the data.

I took this as an opportunity to learn a bit more about a few aspects of Python that were new to me. Webscraping 
with BeautifulSoup & putting together visuals with MatPlotLib.
